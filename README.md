currently devloping: silicon - edge ai tool for visualizing and optimizing models before deployment.

recon - ai-powered ethereum security dashboard live fraudulent transaction detection (random forest classifier) and llm-powered smart contract source code analysis
capit.ai - agentic stock analyzer with rag architecture that provides traders with both fundamental and quantitative analysis for assets
fulcrum - portfolio optimizer that uses k-means clustering to classify held assets, which are used to generate hedges
